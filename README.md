# AI Based 7x7 Board Game

In this project, a two player board game was implemented. The game take place on a 7x7 board. The game is played between AI and a user. At the start of the game the number of pieces that belongs to each player and the maximum number of turns is given by the user. In the beginning, the program asks if the user is Player1 or 2. If user is Player1, the first move is user’s. Otherwise computer makes the first move. Initial position of the pieces should be either selected randomly. The desired moves are checked if valid or not. Player 1's indicator is 'X' and Player 2's indicator is 'O'. Players can only move their piece to one of its four neighbours. Move can be vertical or horizontal. Columns are represented with numbers between “1 and 7”. Rows are represented as letters between “a-g”. The game ends when one of the players can not make a valid move or the turn limit has been reached. When one of the players can not make a valid move, the game ends and the other player will be the winner. When the turn limit is reached, the game ends and the player with more valid moveable space will be the winner.
